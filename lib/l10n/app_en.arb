  "infoText1": "Hiragana is the basic Japanese phonetic script. It represents every sound in the Japanese language.",
  "infoText2": "Each character consists of sounds like 'a' (あ), i' (い), 'u' (う), 'e' (え), 'o' (お) with other characters combining with these 5 sounds to create certain vowels like 'ka' (か), 'ki' (き), 'ke' (け), etc.",
  "infoText3": "By combining these characters we create words. For example: word 'Hiragana' - 'ひらがな' is made of characters like 'ひ' - hi, 'ら' - ra, 'が' - ga (dakuon), 'な' - na. Or another word like 'cat' - 'neko' - 'ねこ' in Japanese is combination of characters like 'ね' - ne, 'こ' - ko. Another example: teacher - sensei - 'せんせい', 'せ' - se, 'ん' - n, 'せ' - se, 'い' - i and so on",
  "infoText4": "To properly learn to read in Japanese it is required to memorize each of these characters",
  "infoText5": "Dakuon in Japanese refers to voiced consonant sounds in hiragana/katakana, created by adding two small dots (called dakuten, ゛) to voiceless characters, changing sounds like k to g, s to z, t to d, and h to b.",
  "infoText6": "When you see ゛on characters remember to not read them same as base hiragana. For example: base hiragana か - 'ka' if it has ゛added on it then it turns to が - 'ga', etc.",
  "infoText7": "Then there is Handakuon which in Japanese refers to half-turbid sounds, specifically the 'p' sounds (pa, pi, pu, pe, po), created by adding a small circle (called a maru or handakuten) to the 'h' row of hiragana/katakana (は, ひ, ふ, へ, ほ). This diacritic changes the consonant from an 'h' sound to a 'p' sound, marking a semi-voiced consonant, contrasting with dakuon (voiced sounds with two dots) and essential for correct pronunciation in Japanese words like pan 'ぱん' - bread.",
  "infoText8": "So instead of reading just は - 'ha' you'd read it as ぱ - 'pa' and so on.",
  "infoText9": "In the Japanese language, yōon refers to a feature where a consonant sound is palatalized by an added 'y' glide sound, resulting in a single contracted syllable or mora.",
  "infoText10": "In both hiragana and katakana, the second character is written as a smaller-than-usual version of the ya - や, yu - ゆ, or yo - よ kana to distinguish it from two separate morae.",
  "infoText11": "When pronounced, the initial 'i' vowel sound is dropped, and the consonant is blended with the 'y' sound to form a single, smooth sound. For example, 'ki' (き) + small 'yo' (ょ) becomes 'kyo' (きょ), as a single sound, not 'kiyō'."
